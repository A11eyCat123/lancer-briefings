## * Handler's Eyes Only *


## ESCORT TO *CENSORED* DEBRIEF - CODE ALPHA 1 FOXTROT FOXTROT GOLF - ROOKIES

The successful transfer of asset **SCHINDLER** to the designated prison facility located on **CENSORED** was a 
spectacular achievement, excellent work Handlers and Lance teams.  Of particular note the actions and leadership
demonstrated by **OZAI** in leading not one, but two seperate tasks to completion while combating wildlife, 
insurgents, and various unforseen circumstances. His capture of the rogue Lancer pilot **BOXER** was a decisive
and bold move we believe will reap incalcuable benefits. The Council recognizes the various achievements in the 
field from both this lauded hero of the Teuflisch Empire, as well as those under his authority on this action.  

**ROOKIES** 

The Lancer teams and their Handlers previously left at the Keta 7.9 Mining facility to root out potential threats
have been recalled.  Due to a major malfunction with your current ships engines, life support, and various 
other systems related to the HVAC, these reinforcements will be arriving with a newly liberated Forge-Class ship
**THE SWORD OF JUSTICE**. **THE SWORD OF JUSTICE** will be your new acting base of operations.  While the Council 
deliberates and awaits further information from the data-core and interrogations, you and the other Lances will be 
assigned to accompany **ADMIRAL ZHAU**.  You will act as his bodyguards, and assist him with any research-related 
activities or tasks **ZHAU** should need to perform to advance his experimental program. 

However, the **SWORD OF JUSTICE** will not arrive for another 37 hours.  Please enjoy the obligatory shore-leave
while stationed aboard your current ship. **ADMIRAL ZHAU** will also be arriving at the close of the 5-day window 
of travel on and off **CENSORED** as he is insisting on pulling as much data from related projects and similar 
research initiatives in the fields of AI and NHPs from the Data-Repository on surface as possible before his 
departure. He will have several agents from **S.O.M.E.G.U.Y.S** escorting him that may or may not accompany you 
further depending on the processing of assets **SHINDLER** and **BOXER**.
