## * Handler's Eyes Only *

## LANCE "TEAM" DEPLOYMENT BRIEF

**Schindler** Is the acting Executive Officer of the Keta 7.9 Mining facility. He is currently under investigation 
for misuse of funds as well as misappropriation/theft of on-site mining materials and equipment.  After several tax 
forms were flagged for internal review and further investigation, findings are consistent with writing off equipment 
well before its expiration and showing “Malfunctions” to be disproportionate to Imperial standards at other similar 
mining operations. This could be could be do to the harsh conditions and strain put upon the “equipment” due to 
Keta 7.9s atmosphere and the properties of the mined ore’s as their interaction with biological respiratory systems 
is largely untested. However, it is well within reason it could be for more nefarious purposes.  

Investigations will be handled by 
**Goth**

**Hoss**

 and **Handler**

**Ozai** will have their Lance placed on standby after the **CORONA** incidient


**Goth’s** Lance will take on interviewing on-site staff, as well as **Schindler** and his security team. These 
interviews take precedence, divert any resources necessary to the completion of this task.
**Hoss** Will take her Lance and make “equipment checks” including interviews if necessary, ensure that living 
conditions are at standardized levels of cleanliness and maintenance.  Report any suspicious behaviour or findings 
incongruent with standard practices for evaluation by command.
**Handler** will take her Lance and do parameter checks as well as investigating what could be an unauthorized 
landing zone, but is potentially a mine entrance/storage structure.  It is noted that as a rookie lance combat will
be less likely given your objective, but if either **Goth** or **Hoss** require reinforcements or additional 
support **Handler’s** Lance will be expected to comply.  

Be prepared to enact “C/SPK/HEAR NO EVIL” Protocols should the risk of exposure to “Equipment” become present 
amongst uninitiated or pilots not yet given **TERMINUS** clearance. 

It is worth noting that they have access to old-model mechs for patrols, ensuring “Equipment” is in-line, and 
protection from piracy.  The base also has a number of weapon emplacements and vehicles equipped for heavy mining 
that could be feasibly turned on personnel.  

**Schindler** is noted as having a recreational hobby that involves restoring/modifying “classic” mech frames, it 
is understood his security mechs may be older models, but are likely upgraded or “Fully-Loaded” and such 
modifications are within lawful statures as a subsidiary branch of the Teuflisch military forces.
