Hacker and Resident Computer Specialist 

## Trivia

* Freebird comes from the fact that he once had a date walk out on him when he tried to serenade her with the song.
* He doesn't fully trust NHPs in his systems, and hates fighting against them.
* He used to be a pacifist until he killed someone who had threatened his family. He still prefers not to be the one doing the shooting thus his position of choice.
* His hobby was some grey hat hacking as a teen, he messed with the wrong people and was given the choice between joining up or going to jail. He is excited by the opportunities to work with this equipment but not a blind believer in the cause.
