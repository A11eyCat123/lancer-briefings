# Mission // #002
## Escort Job

# Goals
- Escort Schindler to the Holding and Inquiry Facility alive
- Ensure his codes/plans/contacts arrive at the Data-Repository intact
- Make it back to the Landing Pad drop-point within the 5-day extraction window

# Stakes
- If Schindler does not make it to the facility alive S.O.M.E.G.U.Y.S. will lose their
opprotunity to extract valuable information from him about his criminal enterprise
- If the digital information and analysis we've collected and condensed on Schindler
does not make it to the Data-Repository we will lose critical time on tracking down
the rest of Schindler's associates who escaped the Keta 7.9 skirmish
- If any pilot should not make it back to the extraction point at the Landing Pad
within the 5-day time frame, their lance will be incapacitated as they wait for the
next break in the atmosphere barrier in aprox 6-8 weeks. They will be disciplined. 

# Reserves
- Most will be unavailble given the difficulty establishing communications below the
Lebonz-Line, pending further review from Lance ability to establish resources.
