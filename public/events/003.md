Upon the decisive victory at the Keta 7.9 mining facility, the **ROOKIES** were sent to escort **SCHINDLER** and his data to several specialized facilities for interrogation, processing, and analyzing.  While in route, they were joined by new pilot Vincent, aka **INDOMITUS**.  Vincent and Wlliam engaged in a nearly catastrophic night of drinking that ended with the a wrestling challange on the condition of witnesses. Nancy and Stan attempted to wrest control of the oncoming mission from the authority of **OZAI** and despite an incredible deep-fake conference call with digital recreations of the other Handlers, were unable to take control of the mission. Hingy developed some more specialized training techniques for her workouts, and Adam started working on his own workout steaming vids. Calliope baked cookies and was able to pass them out to everyone amongst the **ROOKIES** while passing on messages for William. Hingy and Calliope spectated the match between Vincent and William, and just as Vincent prepared to win by surrender, Hingy smashed a bucket of cookies over the heads of them both and won the match declaring "Always expect craisens on the battlefield".

After planetfall, the **ROOKIES** and **FIREBENDERS** formed two squads, each going to a seperate objective.  

Team A led by **OZAI** and comprimised of **INDOMITUS**, **POPPY** and **THERMOSTAT** took **SCHINDLER** to the prison facility located deep in the mountains of the sole planetary continent. As they journeyed, **POPPY** took the last family photo of **OZAI** with his dead wife and son, while also doing research alongside **THERMOSTAT**.  **INDOMITUS** was able to connect with **OZAI** and learn more about his concerns and qualms with the **ROOKIES** and **NANCY WAKE**. The following day, they discovered not only the missing photo, but a damaged tank of a specialized chemical that keeps their mechs from freezing over in the adverse weather conditions on Takkalleellee.  **POPPY** confessed to stealing the photo, and after returning it was ordered to tank point in his Mech and forgo the chemical bath to keep his Mech safe to operate. Close to the prison facility where **SCHINDLER** was to be interred, they were ambushed by both local wildlife known as Kraken Spawne and Black Knights, of note, the Sniper who harrassed them on Keta 7.9.  Overcoming the ambush, **THERMOSTAT** was able to tunnel beneath the battlefield, and take on the Kraken Spawne while **OZAI** was able to escape.  **INDOMITUS** was able to knock over the enemy sniper after they **mistakenly** took the arms of one of the Kraken Spawne pinning **THERMOSTAT** in place. All of Team A was able to make it to the prison, battle damaged but alive, and are on their way back to the Landing Pad to leave this place.

Team B led by **LIGHTNING QUEEN** contained **HANDLER**, **CLOVER**, **RACCOA**, **FALCONER**, AND **BOILING ROCK**
