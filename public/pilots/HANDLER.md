CONGRATS TO ALL PARTICIPENTS SAYDUND OLL LANCERS


**WAKE** please have discussions with the following **ROOKIES** 

-Introduce **INDOMITUS** to the rest of the Lance, as he will be joining the **ROOKIES** from this point moving
forward, he was held back a year due to an issue with his foreign language credit, but he has completed the 
make-up course and is an official graduate of Grendal Military Academy. Given his history with the **ROOKIES**
as a senior student it has been deemed appropriate to place him in their Lance. Dismiss all except the following
three Lancers.

-**POPPY** please question on his decision to "test gravitation well using enemy mech with pilot inside leading
to the escape of confirmed criminal **DOUG FREDRICKS**. Reinforce that this will be treated as an isolated 
incident, but further mistakes will lead to Internal Investigation and potential demotion

-**FREEBIRD** disable their safety protocals briefly after a major impact from an unknown projectile. Please 
determine is this was intentional or a result of the damage sustained by the hit. Follow up with clandestine 
**DETERMINATION** procedures and find out if **FREEBIRD** has been compromised or requires further analysis

## LANCE "ROOKIES" DEPLOYMENT BRIEF

TWO LANCES WILL BE DEOPLOYED ONTO SURFACE OF PLANET, TO ESCORT PRISONER **SCHINDLER** AS WELL AS HIS DIGITAL 
FOOTPRINT AND FILES TO THEIR RESPECTIVE FACILITIES.

Of note, this planet's particular atmosphere and environmental conditions are incredibly harsh and difficult.  
This is ideal given what the Tueflisch empire utilizes the planet for, however, these phenomena mean we have 
a limited window for deploying, and retrieving teams.  Priority of this mission is above **PRIORITY ALPHA-1** 
and we can waste no time in getting the information we can from **SCHINDLER** and his digital assets, once 
you arrive on planet you will have a **5-DAY** operational window. Although the environment is hostile, there 
is numerous forms of wildlife, these are also incredibly hostile and dangerous to both humans as well as mech 
frames. Interference with electronics and signals are to be expected given weather conditions, please be 
prepared for this.  Personel on the surface of the planet will give further details as to safety and security
protocols while on site. The rest of this briefing will be broken into two sections, section **A** will be in 
regards to **SCHINDLER** and **B** will cover his digital assets. Regardless, both teams will be expected to 
complete their objectives in the **5-DAY** timeframe, and will be disciplined and recieve dimerits on failure
to abide by this operational window. 

**BRIEFING A** 

- **SCHINDLER** will be escorted to the prison facility on planet's surface.  He must reach prison alive for
questioning by **SOMEGUYS** and permanent incarceration. Prison facility is designated on map as **POINT 
BRAVO** the team who escorts **SCHINDLER** will land at **POINT ALPHA** then follow the route indicated stopping
at the Automated Guard and Rest Station. Following the route shown on the map, it will take an estimated 1 day
to arrive at the Station, and 1 more to arrive at the prison, then you will have 3 days to return to **POINT
ALPHA** before exfill will become impossible for 6 weeks.

**BRIEFING B** 

- **SCHINDLER'S** information and electronic data have been stored in a digital safe-box known as an **ICEBOX**,
it will confine and restrain any signals ensuring the digital footprint remains isolated. This **ICEBOX** must be
taken to the digital-repository facility located at **POINT CHARLIE** where it can be stored, processed, and
disposed of safely.  Of course, after any useful information for the destruction of the criminal syndicate known
as the **BLACK KNIGHTS** is pulled.  The **ICEBOX** will need to be mounted into a mech frame at **POINT ALPHA**,
but be aware, that the **ICEBOX** will generate a significant amount of additional **HEAT** in the mounted frame.
The team responsible for taking the **ICEBOX** will follow the route highlighted on the map, stopping at the
designated Automated Guard and Rest Station. It should take 1 day to arrive at the Station, and 1 more to arrive
 at the data-repository.  After, you will have 3 days to return to **POINT ALPHA** for exfill or will be trapped
on planet's surface for the next 6 weeks.
