## Trivia

* Falconer came as a default suggested name as she was filling out a form (who knows how long ago) and she can’t figure out how to change it.
* Her grandson Braxton is a ne’er-do-well.
* She did not adequately plan for retirement.
* She did a bit of prison time a number of decades ago. Doesn’t prefer to discuss it, but sometimes it comes up on her record.
