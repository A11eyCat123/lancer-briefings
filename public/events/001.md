Through 3 gruelling years of training, testing, and enhancement, 6 of the 8 members of TEAM have come to graduate   A success rate 50% greater than the average Lance at Teuflisch's premier Lancer Training Academy. Accordingly they have been paired up with a Handler.  She will take charge of mission briefings, intellegince work, deployment, on-site situational appraisal activities, as well as ensuring mission critical objectives are met by the Lance.  Unusually, all 6 gruaduates have been assigned to the same Lance, many speculate this is due to their stupendous track record inside the academy, but all eyes are on them to see if their success will be more than academic.
